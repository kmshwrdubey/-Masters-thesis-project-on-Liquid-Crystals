In the present work I am reporting the dielectric behavior of three FLC series namely QMn/m, En/m and 
QVE n/m..
The comlplex permittivity has been utilized to determine the Dielectric strength(∆ε),relaxation time (τr), 
and relaxation frequency (fr) and the temperature dependence of relaxation time and relaxation frequency 
for all the investigated chiral FLC.The tilted ferroelectric SmC* phase of three structurally different series 
having three aromatic rings in the core structure connected by ester groups with different end alkyl chain 
lengths, all of which are derived from lactic acid, have been observed by broadband dielectric spectroscopy. 
The dielectric spectra strongly depend both on the temperature as well as the specific molecular structure 
of the self-assembling compounds possessing the ferroelectric polar order. The results reveal a strong 
Goldstone mode in the ferroelectric SmC* phase with ~kHz relaxation frequency. In the SmC* phase, the 
real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity increase up to certain temperature near the SmC*-
N*/SmA* transition and then decrease with increasing temperature, perhaps due to the disruption of the 
molecular domains at the onset of the SmA*/N* phase transition. The dielectric strength attains a maximum 
value in the SmC* phase and then decreases near the SmA*/N* phase transition. The dielectric strength is 
also influenced by the length of the alkyl chain and the nature of connecting unit of constituent molecules
